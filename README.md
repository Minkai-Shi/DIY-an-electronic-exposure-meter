# DIY-an-electronic-exposure-meter
This project, part of ["Let's Do Activity" (Session 3)](https://www.eepw.com.cn/event/action/digikey/diy_third.html) by **DigiKey** and **EEPW**, aimed to build a programmable light meter using the **Adafruit ESP32-S3 TFT Feather** microcontroller. The device measures ambient light intensity, calculates optimal photography parameters (ISO, aperture, shutter speed), and enables remote control via WiFi. This project was awarded the **EEPW Excellence Prize** for its innovative technical implementation.
